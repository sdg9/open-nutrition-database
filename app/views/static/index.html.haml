  %h2 Open Nutrition API

  %p
    The #{link_to 'Open Nutrition Database', 'https://github.com/kenmazaika/open-nutrition-database'} is a mashup of API's designed to allow a user to scan a barcode from a smartphone and get nutrition information for the product they are holding in their hand.

  %p
    Because of the way the API is built, the results are not 100% accurate, and every product is not in the database, but it has fairly good results.

  %p
    This is available for free, and requires no API authentication to access the data.

  %h2 How it works

  %p
    First we query for a plain text description for the UPC code.  This is done using both #{link_to 'upcdatabase.org', "http://upcdatabase.org"} and #{link_to 'upcdatabase.com', 'http://upcdatabase.com'}.
    %br
    Once we resolve the product information, we query the nutritional information from #{link_to 'FatSecret', 'http://fatsecret.com'}, and return the mashup of the results to you.
    %br
    %h2 Who it's built for
    %p
      This is a product that is designed for small developers, not large corporations.  There are more accurate, more scalable solutions out there if you are willing to pay.  This is designed to power hobbiest web applications and phone apps.

      %h2 Get Nutrition Information
      .code
        GET #{food_url ':upc', :format => :json}

        .details
          Gets the product information, and nutritional information for a product.  If an item is resolved the description will be populated.  Depending on if we can fetch the data, the other keys (brand_name, product_name, nutrition) may or may not be present.  If the item cannot be resolved at all the endpoint will return a 404.
